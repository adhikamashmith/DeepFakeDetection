# DeepFakeDetection 🚀  

## Overview  
DeepFakeDetection is an AI-powered tool that detects **fake links, statements, videos, and images** using **CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks), LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), and Gemini API**. It uses **Flask** for the backend and **React** for the frontend (without a UI).

## Features  
✅ Detects **fake links** and misleading statements  
✅ Analyzes **videos and images** to identify deepfakes  
✅ Uses **CNN** for image/video analysis  
✅ Uses **LSTM** for text-based deepfake detection  
✅ Integrates **Gemini API** for response verification  
✅ **Flask Backend** for processing requests  
✅ **React Frontend** for handling uploads and results

## Technologies Used  
- **Python (Flask)** 🐍 for backend API  
- **React** ⚛️ for handling file uploads  
- **TensorFlow/Keras** for CNN & LSTM models  
- **OpenCV** for image/video processing  
- **Gemini API** for response validation  
- **Postman** (for testing API endpoints)
